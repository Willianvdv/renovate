**Important note**: For security reasons, GitHub has blocked integrations/apps from editing GitHub Actions workflow files in _any_ branch, so this only works on GitHub if using a Personal Access Token instead of using the WhiteSource Renovate app.

Add to this configuration setting if you need to override any of the GitHub Actions default settings.
